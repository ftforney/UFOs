# The UFO Data Project

## What is this projects goal?
Dana wants to make a webpage that provides data for UFO sightings, and be able to filter the data down as needed. Anyone will be able to access this webpage and easily filter the data to their liking!

## Results of this project
In this project, we've learned how to build a javascript application that works with our html file to provide a dynamic webpage to change what is shown live!

We can now use this webpage to filter the data we want, by filling in each of the fields as shown below and pressing enter as we fill out each field we want.

## Summary
A drawback that I see is no way to easily reset the filters and go back to the original state without manually clearing all the fields.

Because of this, I would add a button to clear the filters in case the user wants to do that. Another recommendation would be to try and make the table more mobile friendly, containing it in its own scrollable container instead of taking up the whole width of the page. While I'm not sure how to do this now, I'm sure I can figure it out in the future!
